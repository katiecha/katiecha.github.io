            <h3 class="myH3">OVERVIEW</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="myPa">The movement known worldwide as Special Olympics began simply as the idea of one extraordinary woman with a vision. Eunice Kennedy Shriver believed that people with intellectual disabilities were far more capable in sports and physical activities than many experts thought. And so, the world’s largest amateur sports organization began in 1962 as a day camp in the backyard of Eunice and Sargent Shriver, with the first International Games taking place in 1968. Today, the movement thrives in more than 172 countries throughout the world.<br><br>

                The mission of Special Olympics PA is to provide year-round sports training and competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community.<br><br>
                
                All training and competition opportunities are provided free of charge to the athletes and their families, enabling everyone to experience the benefits of Special Olympics that extend well beyond the playing field.</p>

            <p class="myPa">I met with the Special Olympics Sports and Volunteer Teams to get a better picture of the issues. They shared the following concerns and issues they found with volunteers attempting to navigate the website.</p><br>

            <p class="myP">“As a new user, I don’t even know where to start. There’s nothing directing you within the Navbar.”<br><br>

                “There’s a lot of duplications between the individual pages and Volunteer Resources. Since it's not organized, it gets confusing.”<br><br>
                
                “A lot of my volunteers don’t know where to click. They get a bit confused. It's overwhelming...They get lost, frustrated, and tired.”</p>
