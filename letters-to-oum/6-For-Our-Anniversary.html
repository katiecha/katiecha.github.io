                Dear Oum Oum,<br><br>
                
                Happy 3 months!<br><br>
                
                You have no idea how grateful I am for you. Every day that you’ve been in my life has been better than the last.<br><br>
                
                These last few months you’ve become my rock. I’m so grateful for all your advice and support through the difficult days. You can always make me smile.<br><br>
                
                I treasure every memory we’ve had together. I remember the first time we met at the poker tournament, our first meetup on BC plaza, our first date at 411 West on Franklin, our many visits to Bella for chicken wings!<br><br>
                
                I’m also so excited for our adventures to come: touring the world, adopting a pet, moving in together! You’re the perfect person for me, and I’m so excited to spend as many moments as I can with you, big or small.<br><br>
                
                Love you to the moon and back, Katie
