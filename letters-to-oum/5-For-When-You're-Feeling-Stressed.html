                Hi Oum!<br><br>

                I’m sorry you're feeling stressed right now. Life can be really hard sometimes, but it always gets better.<br><br>

                If you want to work together, text me this: 👯‍♀️🧑🏾‍💻.<br><br>
                
                But if you’re super busy, I’ll understand. Text me this instead: 🧌🧑🏾‍💻.<br><br>

                Just know that I’m always cheering for you no matter what. You are the most intelligent, thoughtful, and kind person I have ever met, and I know you can do anything you set you mind to.<br><br>

                If there is anything at all that I can help you will, tell me! I want to support you as best as I can.<br><br>

                Love, Katie
