                Hello Oum Oum,<br><br>

                I’m sorry you had a tough day at your job.<br><br>

                I promise that it's gonna get better. Try to get some sleep if you can, and try to take a break. You deserve it! Also, text me this: 🧑🏾‍💻🧟‍♂️.<br><br>

                I don’t know much about the finance world, but I always hear that it’s the hardest at the start. I know you can get through it though. You are so strong and hardworking, and you have all the capabilities to succeed.<br><br>

                You have so many people rooting for you – including me. I’ll always be here for you if you want to call or FaceTime.<br><br>

                Love you always, Katie    
            </p>
