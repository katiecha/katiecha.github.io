                Hello Oum!<br><br>

                It’s the first day of your internship!<br><br>

                Hopefully, you can read this before work, but if not, I hope your day went well. If you do get a chance to read this on your commute sometime between 7:50 am and 8:15 am, I am wishing you good luck and sending you all my love.<br><br> 

                I’m so excited for you to start working and to rediscover your love for distressed. You are the smartest and most hard-working person I know; You make me so proud to be your girlfriend.<br><br>

                Make sure you eat lunch and enjoy yourself this summer. Also, say hi to Alice and Collin for me!<br><br>

                If you’re free, call me when you get out today! I can’t wait to hear how your day went and what happened.<br><br>

                Love, Katie
