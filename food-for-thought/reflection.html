            <h2>an untranslatable word for the feeling you get from the first sip of warm soup</h2>
            <p>As Brillat-Savarin famously stated, “Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you who you are” (Brillat-Savarin 2). It is with this quote that I begin to draw a Venn diagram around food, identity, and memory. For me and many others, foods carry memories – both voluntary and involuntary. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary memories, particularly associated with food, becomes relevant to me in the context of my chosen recipe: kimchi-jjigae [kimchi stew]. Kimchi-jjigae is a Korean soup made of spicy, fermented cabbage also known as kimchi; Some of my earliest involuntary memories are actually related to the dish! My halmeoni [grandmother] would prepare the soup for me and my cousins when we visited over the summer. Now, eating the dish involuntarily brings back memories of my halmeoni’s dolsot [stone bowl], swimming with my cousins, and warm summer days in Maine. These involuntary memories parallel those described by Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson in Accounting for Taste: The Triumph of French Cuisine. In this work, Ferguson poignantly describes a “Proustian example” of involuntary memories associated with a tea-soaked madeleine (Ferguson 4).
            </p>
            <p>My younger self used to think memories and identity were entirely connected – possibly even synonymous. My memories of experiences and interactions helped form my thoughts and opinions. It wasn’t until both of my grandmothers were diagnosed with Alzheimer's that I started looking for a distinction. My halmeoni on my mom’s side was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a year or two before my halmeoni on my dad’s side. It’s difficult watching her become a shell of the vibrant and intelligent woman she once was, and it's equally as difficult watching my other halmeoni follow in her footsteps. When my halmeoni first started losing her memories, I didn’t recognize her at first – her temper and sharpness were the first to go – but I knew she was still there. It was here that I found a meaningful distinction between memory and identity. Memories can help build your identity, but they are also remarkably ephemeral. It takes time and effort to build up an identity that may have been forgotten across a generation. As I reflect on my own identity – specifically as a Korean American – and my memories associated with such, I notice a hole. My recognition of this hole pushed me to contact my halmeoni to get her famous kimchi-jjigae recipe to replicate for this project!
            </p>
            <p>As a slight warning, my halmeoni does not like to measure ingredients – she claims the palm of her hand is better than any measuring cup – and I am not the best cook, so my replication of the dish did not turn out the best. Even still, the chance to connect with my grandmother and carry on her recipe – especially as her memory is fading – was incredibly meaningful. As another aside, I adapted the recipe a bit to make it vegetarian to fit the dietary restrictions of my roommate. Most kimchi-jjigaes are made with some sort of anchovy stock and pork, so I substituted them for water and tofu which probably (negatively) affected the taste as well.
            </p>
            <p>While I was making these adaptations and attempting to translate my halmeoni’s recipe from Korean, I thought back to our discussion of Benjamin Poole’s “French Fast Food and the Myth of Americanisation”. Somewhat similar to French cuisine, Korean cuisine has been altered by Americanisation. While Poole argues that the “Americanisation narrative is a myth that has obscured French complicity in the transnational development of fast food,” I find the myth of Americanisation to be very real in Korea (Poole 2). The presence of the American military has left a considerable mark on the Korean food scene – specifically when looking at the presence of SPAM in popular dishes like budae jjigae [army stew] (“Hunger Games: American Influence Felt in Korean Dishes”). Also, the recent rise in the popularity of Korean food in America has been interesting as someone who was not always proud of my Korean heritage.
            </p>
            <p>To my knowledge, kimchi-jjigae has remained remarkably untouched by American influence. Many people believe that the dish “originated in the mid-Joseon era, during or shortly after the Imjin Wars of 1592 to 1598, when Japan invaded Korea and brought Portuguese traders' chili peppers with them” (Kim). Others assume that the chili peppers were farmed in Korea for thousands of years before. Either way, my experience making the dish was challenging, to say the least. I do not know where I went wrong in the recipe – although I have a few ideas – but overall, I have a lot of respect for my mother, grandmother, and my many ancestors before them for perfecting the dish and passing it down to me! I hope one day I can perfect it as well and share it with my future family. To begin working towards this goal, I chose to make a digital cookbook (https://katiecha.github.io/food-for-thought/) using basic web development skills I have learned in my computer science classes to preserve the recipe (and this reflection)!
            </p>
            <p>In Korean – like many other languages – there are a few untranslatable words. My favorite untranslatable Korean word is 시원하다. According to academic Jenna Gibson, it means “the feeling you get from a fresh breeze or the first sip of warm soup” (Gibson). Even though my version of my halmeoni’s kimchi-jjigae did not turn out perfect, it still gave me this feeling. When me and my roommate tried our creation, I was transported back to Maine with my cousins and grandmother. 
            </p>
            <p>Cooking and cuisine have the power to transport, inspire, connect, and more. As Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson expertly states, “Cooking gives us food for thought; cuisine offers thoughts for food” (Ferguson 6). It is within this dichotomy or more so continuum that something as fleeting and ephemeral as a piece of food becomes a larger symbol of a culture and society. While I may have a lot more to learn about cooking, I am immensely grateful for the opportunity this class gave me to reflect on cuisine, and I am excited to continue in the future.
